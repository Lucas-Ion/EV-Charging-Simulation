# [Access the cloud deployed Task 2A by clicking here ðŸ›œ](https://reonic-simulation-dashboard.onrender.com/)
### Some information about the cloud deployed Task 2A. The UI is built with React, TypeScript and Tailwind. I then connected the simulation algorithm written in Python from Task 1 to a Flask Server that is deployed to the cloud. The Frontend  takes in the input values as described and renders the live output based on the results from the simulation.

## `Task 1 `

### 1. First begin by downloading the repo.

### 2. To run Task 1, navigate to the folder `Task-1`

### 3. Ensure that you have created a virtual python enviroment using: `python -m venv venv`

### 4. Then activate your virtual enviroment using: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 5. Then ensure you have numpy installed in your virtual enviroment using: `pip3 install numpy`

### 6. Then you can simply run the simulator using: `python3 charging_sim.py`

### Note: For your convenience I have also added a Jupyter Notebook which is visible within the GitHub. It also contains all my bonus answers as described in the assignment.

## `Task 2A `

## How to run the code locally if you desire:

### 1. To run Task 2, navigate to the folder `Task-2`

### 2. Open one terminal window

### 3. Navigate to `reonic-frontend`

### 4. Now run `npm install`

### 5. Now run `npm run dev`

### 6. The UI should be up and running on your local host!

# Note: If you are running into any issues getting the code up and running on your local machine please do not hesitate to reach out.
