## How to run the code locally if you desire

## For `Task 1 `

### 1. First begin by downloading the repo.

### 2. To run Task 1, navigate to the folder `Task-1`

### 3. Ensure that you have created a virtual python enviroment using: `python -m venv venv`

### 4. Then activate your virtual enviroment using: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 5. Then ensure you have numpy installed in your virtual enviroment using: `pip3 install numpy`

### 6. Then you can simply run the simulator using: python3 charging_sim.py

### Note: For your convenience I had also added a jupyter notebook which is visible as well from within the GitHub. It also contains all my bonus answers
